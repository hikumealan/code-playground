<p className="primary-story">Chip groups are typically used in filter and selection use cases to indicate to the user what selections they have made. They separate selections by attribute, for added clarity. Chip groups also give users the ability to either delete an entire chip group at once using the group X, or delete individual chips at a time.</p>
