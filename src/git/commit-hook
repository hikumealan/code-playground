You can create a Git commit message hook that enforces the Conventional Commits specification by following these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the Git repository where you want to add the hook.

2. Create a new file called "commit-msg" in the ".git/hooks" directory. You can use the following command to create the file:

   ```
   touch .git/hooks/commit-msg
   ```

3. Make the file executable by running the following command:

   ```
   chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
   ```

4. Open the "commit-msg" file in your preferred text editor.

5. Add the following code to the "commit-msg" file:

   ```
   #!/bin/sh

   commit_msg_file=$1
   commit_msg=$(cat $commit_msg_file)

   if ! echo "$commit_msg" | grep -qE '^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,72}$'; then
       echo >&2 "error: Commit message does not adhere to Conventional Commits specification"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

   This code checks if the commit message starts with one of the allowed prefixes (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore), followed by an optional scope in parentheses, and a colon. The message body must then follow, up to a maximum of 72 characters. If the commit message does not adhere to this format, the hook will exit with an error message.

6. Save the changes to the "commit-msg" file and exit the text editor.

7. Test the hook by making a commit with a message that does not adhere to the Conventional Commits specification. For example:

   ```
   git commit -m "Fixing bug"
   ```

   This should trigger the hook and display an error message.

That's it! Now any commits with messages that do not adhere to the Conventional Commits specification will be rejected.
