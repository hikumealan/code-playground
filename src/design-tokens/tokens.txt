It is important to note that design tokens are not just for designers. They are also for developers. By using design tokens, developers can ensure that their code is consistent with the design system. This makes it easier to maintain and update the code, and it also makes it easier for designers and developers to collaborate.

Here are some additional tips for using design tokens effectively:

Use a consistent naming convention for your design tokens. This will make it easier to find and use the tokens.
Document your design tokens. This will help designers and developers understand how to use the tokens.
Use a version control system to track changes to your design tokens. This will help you to keep track of changes and to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Test your design tokens in different browsers and devices. This will help you to ensure that the tokens look and behave the same way across different platforms.
