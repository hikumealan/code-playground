/*
Here are some tips on how to harden the security features of an Express.js web server:

Use a strong secret key for session management. The secret key should be a random string of at least 32 characters.
Encrypt sensitive data. Sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, should be encrypted before they are stored or transmitted.
Use a secure cookie storage mechanism. Cookies should be stored in a secure location, such as the browser's local storage or session storage.
Filter all input data. All input data, such as query parameters and form data, should be filtered to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Use a content security policy (CSP). A CSP is a security policy that can be used to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded by a web page.
Keep your software up to date. Make sure to keep your Express.js web server and all of its dependencies up to date.
Use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF is a security device that can be used to filter and block malicious traffic.
Monitor your server for suspicious activity. Use a security monitoring tool to monitor your server for suspicious activity, such as unusual login attempts or denial-of-service attacks.
By following these tips, you can help to harden the security of your Express.js web server and protect it from attack.

/*
This code will create an Express app that serves the web app on the / route and the API on the /api route. The web app will be served from the dist directory, and the API will be served from the current directory.

The use() method is used to register a middleware function with the Express app. The middleware function is called for each request that matches the route that it is registered with.

The session() middleware function is used to enable session management in the Express app. The secret property is used to generate a secret key that is used to encrypt the session data. The resave and saveUninitialized properties are used to control when the session data is saved.

The listen() method is used to start the Express app listening on the specified port.
