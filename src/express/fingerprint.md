To gather additional information about a user connecting to the server, you can incorporate various techniques and modules. Here's an expanded version of the previous Node.js script that includes gathering geolocation data and request headers:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const useragent = require('express-useragent');
const requestIp = require('request-ip');
const geoip = require('geoip-lite');

const app = express();
app.use(useragent.express());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const ip = requestIp.getClientIp(req);
  const userAgent = req.useragent.source;
  const os = req.useragent.os;
  const browser = req.useragent.browser;

  // Additional information gathering
  const language = req.headers['accept-language'];
  const referer = req.headers['referer'];

  // Geolocation data using IP address
  const geo = geoip.lookup(ip);
  const country = geo ? geo.country : 'Unknown';

  // Log or process the gathered information as needed
  console.log('IP:', ip);
  console.log('User Agent:', userAgent);
  console.log('OS:', os);
  console.log('Browser:', browser);
  console.log('Language:', language);
  console.log('Referer:', referer);
  console.log('Country:', country);

  res.send('Information gathered.');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this updated script, we've added the following:

1. The `request-ip` module is used to retrieve the client's IP address.
2. The `geoip-lite` module is used to perform IP-based geolocation lookup to determine the country.
3. The `accept-language` header is accessed to gather the user's preferred language.
4. The `referer` header is accessed to capture the referring URL.

The gathered information, including the user's IP address, user agent, operating system, browser, language preference, referer, and country (based on geolocation lookup), is logged or processed as required.

Make sure to install the additional modules (`request-ip` and `geoip-lite`) using npm (`npm install request-ip geoip-lite`) before running the script.

Remember to handle user data responsibly and comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations when collecting and processing user information.
