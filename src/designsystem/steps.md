Sure, here's a step-by-step process for building out a design system named Zenith that follows all the guidelines and best practices:

1. Define the core values and purpose of the Zenith design system, and ensure that all design decisions align with these values and purpose.

2. Establish a design language that includes typography, color palette, iconography, and other key design elements. Document the design language in a style guide that is easily accessible to all team members.

3. Create a set of foundational components, including buttons, forms, and other key UI elements. Ensure that these components are modular and scalable, and that they adhere to the design language and accessibility guidelines.

4. Expand the component library to include additional UI components as needed, based on user needs and feedback. Ensure that each component is documented in the style guide and adheres to the design language and accessibility guidelines.

5. Create motion guidelines that define how animations and transitions are used throughout the design system. Ensure that these guidelines are consistent with the design language and help to enhance the user experience.

6. Establish editorial guidelines that define the tone of voice and messaging for the design system. Ensure that the guidelines are consistent with the core values and purpose of the system, and that they help to create a cohesive and engaging user experience.

7. Develop a governance model that outlines how the design system is managed and updated over time. Ensure that the model includes clear roles and responsibilities for all team members, and that it facilitates ongoing collaboration and communication.

8. Test the design system thoroughly to ensure that it is accessible, usable, and effective for users. Iterate on the system as needed based on user feedback and ongoing testing.

9. Launch the Zenith design system and ensure that it is well-communicated to all stakeholders and users. Provide ongoing support and resources to ensure that the system is used effectively and consistently across all projects.

Remember that building a design system is an ongoing process, and it requires ongoing collaboration and communication among all team members. With these steps in mind, you can build a robust and effective design system that supports the needs of your users and your organization.
